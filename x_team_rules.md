S# X-Team 75 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
  * The team leader will assign the tasks based on their ability.
  * If they don't know how to do the task assigned, or have some diffuclties, ask other to help.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
  * See Github commit page
  * If one team member is done, that team member should write e-mail to other team members or post on the Canvas group page to inform the progress


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
  * Discuss problems found through wechat and find a time to met up to work on the issue
  * If no one can solve the problem, use Google, Piazza, the professor/TA, or StackOverFlow



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
  * Calendar

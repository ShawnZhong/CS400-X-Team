## X-Team 75 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How will we assign (and reassign) tasks
  * The team leader will assign the tasks based on their ability.
  * Distribute tasks evenly based on estimated amount of code to write task and difficult of task.
  * If they don't know how to do the task assigned, or have some diffuclties, ask others to help.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
  * We can keep track of the progress on the Github commit page
  * If one team member is done, that team member should write e-mail to other team members or post on the Canvas group page to inform the progress
  * Send team leader a message upon completion of a task
  * Notify team leader if an assigned task will not be completed by the assigned date it should be finished


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
  * Discuss problems found through wechat and find a time to met up to work on the issue
  * If no one can solve the problem, use Google, Piazza, the professor/TA, or StackOverFlow



## How will we back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
  * We will meet together before the deadline and finish the unfinished parts of the assignment.
  * Before one week, one day, 12 hours, 2 hours of the deadline, team should inform and notify the teammate who do the task about the progress and the completion by e-mails, phone calls or having individual/group meeting.
  * Frequently track and post the progress to inform the team.
  * If emergency happens, inform other team members and team leader immediately.
